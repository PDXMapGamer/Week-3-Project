Week 3 project - Build a cookie clicker

#TODO: make size of button scale to the size of browser AND make it not overflow from the button

Bug 1: setInterval only execute once. Solution: wrote =+ (= + after prettier autoformat) which set total cookies to be equal to CPS instead of incrementally adding it on
